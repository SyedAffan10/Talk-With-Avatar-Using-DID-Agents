# Talk With Avatar Using DID Agents

This project demonstrates the use of D-ID's `talks` API for creating AI-driven video agents capable of interactive communication. The front-end is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it integrates with the D-ID API to handle video streams and chat functionalities.

Hereâ€™s how the demo looks:

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

     npm install -g http-server
     ```
   - Start the server with no cache:
     ```bash
     http-server -c-1
     ```

3. Run the project:
   - Open `index-agents.html` in a browser.

## Usage

- **Starting a Conversation:**

- **Video Streaming:**
  - The agent's responses are streamed as video, and the video element updates dynamically during the conversation.
